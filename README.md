# Transfer-function-prediction-using-machine-learning
Deep learning (feedforward neural network) code is in the form of jupyter notebook using Tensorflow. 
The main script for RBF interpolation is RBF_train_predict_modelname.m. 
The code of generating the discrete reduced transfer function  
is in the folder “compute_Vand_Reduced_transferfunction”. 
The folder “training data generation” contains the code for computing the 
training data and testing data for machine learning that can be directly used 
as input data of the RBF and feedforward neural networks.
